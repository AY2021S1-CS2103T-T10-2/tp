## Project: TR4CKER

TR4CKER is a desktop app that helps SoC students track their tasks, meet their deadlines, and stay productive. It is 
optimized for Computing students familiar with CLI, who can manage their tasks efficiently by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=ruilingk)

* **Morphing of AddressBook:** 
  * Refactor Person class to Task class.

* **New Feature**: Added tag command.
  * What it does: Allows users to add and/or delete tag(s) from an existing task.
  * Justification: This feature makes TR4CKER more intuitive for users to use as it does not override current tags
  (which was what it used to do in AB3). It can add tags to existing tags.
  * Highlights: This new feature can add and/or delete multiple tags at one go without users having to type multiple commands.

* **Documentation:**
  * User Guide:
    * Edited documentation for `Quickstart`, `Features` and the feature `edit`: [\#50](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/pull/50)
    * Added documentation for the feature `tag`.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) under Appendix: Requirements: [\#13](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/pull/13)

* **Community:**
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#15](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/pull/15)
