## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tr4cker/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tr4cker/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tr4cker/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tr4cker/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tr4cker/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Tr4ckerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tr4cker/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the TR4CKER data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `tr4cker`, which `Person` references. This allows `tr4cker` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tr4cker/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the tr4cker data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.tr4cker.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Categorised Tasks Handling feature in Home tab \[coming in v1.3] (Han Wei)

### Feature introduction
This feature allows users to view and handle tasks under 3 categories separately.

### Implementation details
This feature comes in the form of a Task List panel, which is made up of three sub-panels:
1. Pending tasks (Incomplete tasks that are not overdue)
2. Expired tasks (Incomplete tasks that are overdue)
3. Completed tasks (Archived tasks)

Upon starting the app or refreshing of task lists, tasks which deadlines have passed will automatically appear under Expired tasks panel.
Users can modify tasks displayed in the Expired task panel using the Edit command.

The following diagram shows the sequence flow of a EditCommand which modifies the deadline of a task in the Expired task list:
![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)
Figure 1: Edit deadline of expired task Activity Diagram

Once the user marks a task as complete, it will automatically appear under Completed tasks.

### Design considerations:

#### Aspect 1: How users can easily view and control all the tasks
This design filters the tasks into 3 lists according to their completion statuses and deadlines which will be useful to the users,
as opposed to having browse through a long task list.

### Planner feature \[coming in v1.3] (Rui Ling)
TR4CKER has a planner feature which provides users to view the calendar side-by-side with the tasks that are due on
specified day. This feature is to allow users to have a clearer view of their schedules and allow them to plan their
time ahead, and hence increasing productivity.

The 2 main functions of Planner command are to:
1. Switch to planner tab
2. Display an overview of tasks for today/tomorrow and on specified date/month

#### Implementation
To implement the UI of this planner feature, there is a `planner` package in `model` and `ui` packages. To implement
the commands of this planner feature, there are `PlannerCommand` and `PlannerCommandParser` classes in `logic` package.
The following class diagram (Figure 1) summarises how the UI aspect of this planner feature is being implemented:
![PlannerClassDiagram](images/PlannerClassDiagram.png)
Figure 1: Planner Class Diagram

During the initialisation of TR4CKER, `PlannerTabWindow` will be initialised, together with `PlannerCalendarPanel` and
`TaskListPanel`. `PlannerTabWindow` will execute `Logic#getPlannerFilteredTaskList` to update the tasks list shown in
Planner tab. The month and year of the calendar will be set in `PlannerCalendarPanel`. There are multiple `PlannerDayCard`
in 1 `PlannerCalendarPanel`. `PlannerDayCard` serves to store the details of each `PlannerDay`, which contains the date
of each grid in the `PlannerCalendarPanel`. When users execute planner commands, The month and year of the calendar will
be updated in `PlannerCalendarPanel`. Existing details of the calendar will also be cleared through
`PlannerCalendarPanel#clearCalendar()` and `PlannerDayCard#clear()`. At the same time, the tasks list will also be updated.

The following sequence diagram (Figure 2) shows how the planner feature works when a user executes `planner goto/today`:
![PlannerSequenceDiagram](images/PlannerSequenceDiagram.png)
Figure 2: Planner Sequence Diagram during execution of `planner goto/today`

When a user executes a `PlannerCommand` of `planner goto/today`, `MainWindow` will be called to execute the command. It will
then call `LogicManager` to execute, followed by parsing of command in `Tr4ckerParser`. `Tr4ckerParser` will create a new
instance of `PlannerCommandParser` to parse the user's input. After parsing and checking the validity of user's input, a
new `PlannerCommand` instance is created. This new instance `plannerCommand` will be passed back to `LogicManager` to execute
on the `Model` in `PlannerCommand`. After executing, a new instance `CommandResult` `commandResult` is created. `commandResult`
will be passed back to `MainWindow`, then it will be checked in `PlannerTabWindow` if the user wants to switch to Planner
tab, or to view a specific date/month. After that, the calendar and tasks list are updated in Planner tab, and user can
now see the results.

The following activity diagram (Figure 3) summarises what happens when a user executes the 2 main functions of
`PlannerCommand`:
![PlannerActivityDiagram](images/PlannerActivityDiagram.png)
Figure 3: Planner Activity Diagram

This activity diagram shows all the possible paths TR4CKER can take when a user executes a `PlannerCommand`. After
inputting a command, the command is parsed. By checking the arguments provided by the user, it can either mean the
user wants to:
1. switch to Planner tab
2. display an overview of tasks for today/tomorrow and on a specified date/month.

If user wants to switch to Planner tab, TR4CKER will display the planner, and a feedback will be provided to the user. If
user wants to display an overview of tasks, the validity of input will be checked. The input can take these 5 different paths:
1. today
2. tomorrow
3. specified date
4. specified month
5. error (not shown here).

Depending on the inputs, the calendar view and tasks list will be updated accordingly. Planner tab is then displayed to
the user and a feedback is provided.

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect 1: How users can easily navigate to today's/tomorrow's tasks list

* **Current Choice:** Use the same `planner` command to navigate to today's/tomorrow's tasks list. For example,
`planner goto/today` would navigate users to today's tasks list and `planner goto/tomorrow` would navigate users to
tomorrow's tasks list. Short forms are also provided such as `tdy` and `tmr`.
  * Pros: User-friendly as users would only need to know 1 command.
  * Pros: Users can use short forms, which increase convenience.
  * Cons: Users may not utilise this feature as they do not know the existence of it.

* **Alternative 1:** Separate commands to allow users to navigate to today's/tomorrow's tasks list.
  * Pros: Clearer error messages to prompt users that the input does not conform to standard.
  * Cons: Need to ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.
  * Cons: Not as user-friendly as users would need to know multiple commands now.

**Justification for current choice:** After thinking about how different commands would also have their own advantages,
I chose to implement the current choice. The current implementation would allow users to only know 1 command, which would
fairly be more user-friendly, especially after considering how TR4CKER also has many other commands available.
The problem of users not knowing the existence of this command could be solved by documenting this feature clearly in the
User Guide of TR4CKER.

##### Aspect 2: \[tbc]

### Countdown feature \[coming in v1.3] (Wen Ling)
TR4CKER has a countdowns tab which allows users to add important dates and times that they would like TR4CKER to countdown to.
This feature allows users to isolate the most important time sensitive events and deadlines, and know exactly how much time
they have before a certain event, which enhances the tracking experience.

The 2 main functions of the Countdown feature are to:
1. Display a countdown of all events to be tracked
2. Display the next upcoming event

#### Implementation \[will be updated with UML diagrams]
The countdown panel is facilitated by the `CountdownPanel` class, which serves as the entry point to show users the countdown
events as a list.

To illustrate how the 2 functions work step-by-step, given below are 3 example usage scenarios:

1. Displays all upcoming countdowns

2. Displays the next upcoming event

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect 1: Users should be able to easily view the next most recent event

* **Current Choice:** Use the same `countdown` command to navigate to the next event or previous event. For example,
`countdown first` would display the earliest upcoming event, `countdown next` will display the event after the one
currently displayed, and `countdown previous` with display the event before the one currently displayed.
  * Pros: Users can easily know the chronological sequence of events.
  * Cons: May be difficult to navigate if there is a long list of events.

* **Alternative 1:** Another command to allow users to navigate to the events in a specified day.
  * Pros: More user-friendly as it is faster to navigate to a particular event on a particular day.
  * Cons: Requires user to already know what days have events in the countdown list.

**Justification for current choice:** Considering how users who are using the countdown feature will prefer to be able
to know what is the next upcoming event, for example what is the next exam that they have to prepare for. The first implementation
is also less prone to errors as users do are able to know what is the next event without knowing beforehand what day is it on.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current tr4cker state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous tr4cker state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone tr4cker state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and
`Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial tr4cker state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single tr4cker state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th task in the tr4cker. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the tr4cker after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved
in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted tr4cker state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/task 1 â€¦â€‹` to add a new task. The `add` command also calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified tr4cker state to be saved into the `tr4ckerStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will
not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the tr4cker state will not be saved into the `tr4ckerStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo`
command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the
left, pointing it to the previous tr4cker state, and restores the tr4cker to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0,
pointing to the initial tr4cker state, then there are no previous tr4cker states to restore. The `undo` command uses
`Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end
at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer`
once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the tr4cker to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index
`addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest tr4cker state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to
restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error
to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the tr4cker, such as `list`,
will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the
`addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all tr4cker states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged.
Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop
applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire tr4cker.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
